"""The mirror as a process: what the entrypoint does when the mirror ends.

`mirroring` is the loop `python -m dccex_usb` runs — the mirror on a
task of its own and the bus drained beside it — and what is asserted here is
its side of that arrangement: a mirror that cannot serve ends the process
rather than leaving it draining a bus with no TCP port and no device (#526).
A box whose 2560 is already taken, or whose command station is not enumerated
yet, depends on the exit: `restart: unless-stopped` is what tries again.

There is no device here and no broker. The station is a stand-in whose `run()`
the test writes, because what is under test is the entrypoint's observation of
a mirror rather than the mirror — that is `test_station.py`'s — and the flash
ordering the teardown owes a half-written station is `test_firmware.py`'s.
