"""A real `mosquitto`, for the suites that test against a broker.

Here rather than in `tests/harness.py`, which is the in-process assembly and
nothing else: what these build is a second process on a port of its own, and
the apps that come up alone against one (ADR-0059, decision 5) each want the
same fixture.

Where no `mosquitto` is installed the suites that take `broker` skip, so a
machine without one still runs everything else. Under CI they fail instead:
a broker is software and belongs in the gate where hardware does not (#372),
so a failed install has to redden the gate rather than quietly delete every
suite built on the bus (#423). `CI` in the environment tells the two apart.
