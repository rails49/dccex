"""The translator as its own process: what it takes for it to come up alone.

Against a real broker and a real listener on real sockets, because that is
what is under test — an app started against nothing, in whatever order the
machine brings the two up (ADR-0059, decision 5). The station is reached by
**address** here rather than by the injected connection `test_translator.py`
drives: an address is what `--station` gives and opening it is what this
command line has to get right. Nothing needs hardware, which is the rule the
whole gate sits under.

There is no store here and no fixture for one, and no railroad's name either:
hardware needs no layout, so this app reads no documents and the order the
scheduler's and dispatcher's suites exercise does not exist for it.

The loop runs on a thread here and is ended with the event `serve` takes; in
the deployment it is the main thread, asyncio owns it, and a signal ends it.
What a test waits on is the station's end of the wire — a message arriving
there is the app having drained the broker's queue on the loop thread and
written to the socket.
