"""The translator over one connection, with a socket pair standing in for the
command station.

The connection is injected, so the test holds the station's end of every
attempt the app makes and nothing here needs hardware: the gate is green on a
machine with nothing plugged in, which is the acceptance criterion the rest
of them sit under (#289). What is asserted is the seam — the bytes that go
out, and the two rows that come back on the bus.

The suite has no asyncio plugin, so each test is a coroutine handed to
`asyncio.run`, and what a test waits on is the station's end of the wire: a
message arriving there is the app having acted.
