"""`python -m dccex_usb` — the command line the container runs.

The device to open and the port to serve it on are the mirror's own two flags
and the whole of what it was for a while (ADR-0043). What the rest are for is
the one thing this app does that is not mirroring: writing a released build
onto the command station, which only the process holding the device can do
(ADR-0065, `firmware.py`). There is still no bind address, because the server
binds every interface and what limits its reach is the LAN (ADR-0042).

- `--broker <host:port>`, where the gesture arrives and where a refusal goes.
- `--firmware-releases <url>`, where releases are read from, defaulting to
  this installation's fork. **Configuration and never payload**: the LAN
  carries no authentication on purpose, so a source on the wire would let
  anyone on the wifi run an arbitrary binary on the command station.
- `--id`, the name its refusals are keyed by, defaulting to the package's.

**The mirror does not wait for the broker**, where the five apps that publish
opening rows do (`lib/startup.py`, step 2). It has no opening rows to publish,
and the port it serves is what DecoderPro, JMRI and the hand-held throttles
reach the command station through — a broker that is not there must not take
the command station away with it, which is the promise this app exists for.
The client connects in the background and its subscription goes again with
every reconnect, so a flash asked for after the broker comes back is answered
(`lib/mqtt.py`).

**No documents and no railroad**, for the translator's reasons one level down
(ADR-0059, decisions 5 and 6): nothing here is looked up in a drawing, and
a railroad loaded under it changes neither the cable nor the station on the
end of it.

**asyncio owns this process.** The mirror is a loop and the bus's network
thread only fills a queue, so the drain beside the mirror is what hands a
gesture to the loop — which is the thread that closes the device and runs
esptool, the same thread that would otherwise be writing a client's bytes to
it.
