"""The command station's serial device, mirrored on a TCP port.

The command station is reached over USB only and one process can own the
device, so that process is this app and everything else is a client of the
port it serves (ADR-0043): the translator, JMRI, hand-held throttles. They
coexist, and DecoderPro keeps working with every app of ours down.

It is a mirror, not a protocol. Every byte read from the device is written to
every connected client unchanged, because one serial stream cannot say who
asked — a reply to one client and a broadcast to all look alike on it. The
only reading it does is `<` and `>`, and only the other way: a client's bytes
are held until its message is whole and then written in one write, so two
clients never interleave a command (framing.py). A client that goes away
mid-message takes its partial message with it.

**A client that has stopped reading is cut off.** The fan-out is a write per
client with nobody waiting on it, so a client that never takes its bytes — a
sleeping laptop, a throttle whose Wi-Fi dropped — has them buffered for it
without limit until the process dies of it and every other client loses the
command station too. Once more than `MAX_OUTSTANDING_BYTES` is outstanding to
one, its connection is closed and the log says why. Not a bounded buffer that
discards: this direction is unframed, so dropping from the middle hands the
client half a message it reads as garbage, and not silence either: a peer that
has gone is reported rather than absorbed (ADR-0050). It may reconnect and
pick the live conversation up.

**While the device is away a client's messages are dropped**, not queued. A
command is honored now or ignored: a queue that flushes on reconnect is a
train that moves minutes after someone asked for it. Reopening the device is
this app's own business — it goes away when the command station is switched
off — so it retries with backoff, and a client notices only that what it
sent meanwhile did nothing. Every way the device can fail to be there is the
same outage — a path that is not there, one that will not take the line
discipline, one that is gone again the moment it is open — and the watcher
outlives all of them.

**An outage that outlasts the grace takes the clients with it.** A client
cannot tell an away device from a quiet one, and this port has no way to
tell it: the socket closing is the whole signal, and it is the one that ends
the translator's session and lowers `device/link` (ADR-0066). So a device
still away two reopens in has every connected client disconnected. Inside
the grace nothing changes — a blip the first reopen recovers costs no
throttle a reconnect, which is what the grace is for. The grace is the
outage's and not each client's: one that connects while an outage is being
waited out leaves with the rest, however briefly it has been there, and one
that connects after an outage has already taken its clients starts the next
grace and gets all of it.

There is no client limit beyond the OS's and no authentication: the LAN is
the trust boundary (ADR-0042), and the port is published to it by the
container. The server binds every interface for the same reason.

**The device is let go on demand and taken back after**, which is `released()`
and the one thing here that is not the mirror's own business: writing the
station's flash means owning the port, and the process holding it is the only
one that can hand it over (ADR-0065). What is done with it meanwhile is
`firmware.py`'s; this class still speaks no bus topic and reads no payload.
