"""The mapping: one desired value in, the exact bytes the station is sent out.

Every row of the device vocabulary this app recognises has a function here,
and each is **pure** — no socket, no state, no clock — so the whole protocol
is asserted as "this value, these bytes" on a machine with nothing plugged
in. The `<…>` syntax is this app's private business and appears nowhere else
in the repository (ADR-0043); [docs/dccex/README.md](../../../docs/dccex/README.md)
is where it is written down.

Three of the seven functions answer `None`. A value this app cannot put on a
wire — a position that is neither `closed` nor `thrown`, an aspect no head
here is wired for, a function value the station's binary `<F>` cannot express
— sends **nothing** rather than something near it: a translator that guessed
would move a turnout the layout did not ask for, and a faked action is worse
than silence, which is the same rule that keeps a commanded position from
being echoed back as a measured one (ADR-0022, ADR-0050).

The one word that is not a table row is here too, `STATUS`, the whole of what
a poll is made of, because it is bytes on the same wire and belongs beside
the rest of the protocol. So is `startup`, which is the one function that
maps nothing: it hands over what a person wrote, because a file of raw
station commands exists precisely so that this app needs no vocabulary for
what is in it.
