"""`python -m tc49.dccex` — the translator as a process of its own.

Every app comes up alone (ADR-0059, decision 5). Started against an empty
broker with nothing else running and no command station on the other end of
the port, this connects, publishes its own two retained rows — the railroad
dark and the station unreached — and stays up, retrying the mirror on a
backoff of its own; it exits on nothing but a signal. Nothing here is ordered
by anything else coming up first, which is why compose carries no
`depends_on`.

**No railroad and no store.** Hardware needs no layout: this app reads the
wanted rows and writes what it observes, and it does not know that layouts
exist (ADR-0059, decision 5). Where the other five processes are told which
railroad they run, there is nothing here for the name to select — no document
is read, and an address is the string the hardware answers to rather than
something looked up (decision 6). So the flags are where the broker is, where
the mirror is, and the two values that are this deployment's rather than the
railroad's:

- `--station <host:port>`, where the `dccex-usb` mirror serves the command
  station (rails49/dccex). Not the USB device: this app is one client of
  that port beside JMRI and the hand-held throttles.
- `--startup <file>`, the raw station commands sent on powering the rails —
  the per-district trip currents, in the station's own language, which is the
  one place those values appear (#217). Optional: a railroad with none comes
  up at whatever the firmware defaults to.
- `--id`, the name its link row is keyed by (#368, decision 7), defaulting to
  the package's. A value and not a contract: it appears in no drawing, no
  configuration and no list of ours, and it is a key only because one railroad
  may have several participants and the second's `up` would otherwise erase
  the first's `down`.

Neither the drain period nor the poll nor the backoff is a flag — nothing
outside this process has an opinion about how often it takes what the broker's
network thread left waiting, and what the station is asked and how often a
lost link is retried are the translator's own (translator.py).

**The id names the broker's client too**, `tc49-<id>`, where the other apps
name themselves after the package. This is the one app a railroad may run
twice — two stations, two translators, decision 7 — and two clients sharing
one client id take turns disconnecting each other on the broker for as long as
both are up.

**A railroad loaded under it changes nothing here.** The other five apps
follow `tc49/layout/state/railroad` and rebuild on the railroad it names
(ADR-0060); this one takes no `--railroad` and owns no row keyed by a
railroad — the link it has and the supply it reports are the command
station's, and the station is still the same station. So it stands, and its
rows stand with it (`tests/system/test_reload.py`).

The startup order is `lib/startup.py`'s, with no store in it. **No
documents**: an app that reads nothing cannot be brought up in the wrong order
with respect to one that serves documents. Then the broker, and `DccEx` on it,
the constructor stating this app's two opening rows — `device/link/<id>: down`
and a dark `device/track` carrying why. **No rows of a previous process to
adopt**, and none of this app's own to read back: the two it owns are stated
by the constructor. What it does wait for is the *desired* picture, which is
`layout`'s to write and the broker's to retain — and it is waited for
**before the link is opened**, so that the whole of it is held when the first
connection is handed it. That is what keeps the track row first: `_applied()`
orders a connect's picture, where a value arriving over a link that is already
up is acted on as it arrives, and a speed reaching the station ahead of the
power is a locomotive that rolls the moment somebody makes the rails live
(#333, ADR-0054).

Then the loop: `DccEx.run()` keeping the link, and a drain beside it.

**asyncio owns this process.** `DccEx._send` writes to an
`asyncio.StreamWriter` from inside a bus subscriber, so whichever thread
drains the bus is the thread that writes to the station. With the loop owning
the process every subscriber runs on the loop thread and that write is already
where it belongs; the MQTT client's callback only appends to a queue on its
own network thread, and the drain here is what hands those frames to the loop
(lib/mqtt.py). A daemon thread under a synchronous owner would mean
marshalling a cross-thread write that does not exist today.

The railroad is stood down before the process ends, on the signal as well as
on the stop: zero to every locomotive this app has commanded and then the
track off, because the station goes on running whatever it was last told and
an exit over a rolling locomotive leaves it rolling. It comes **before** the
link is let go — cancelling `DccEx.run` closes the writer, and zeros sent
after that have nowhere to go.

`DccEx` is handed a `Bus` and nothing else in the package changes: which
binding it got is this file's business, and a desired value that cannot be
read is dropped exactly as it was in one process (#289, BUS.md rule 4) —
under MQTT whoever published it is another container, and a bug there must not
take the thing that drives the railroad down with it.
