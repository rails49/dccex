"""What the station says, and the two facts this app reads out of it.

The station writes `<…>` messages to every client, replies and unasked
broadcasts alike, and one byte stream cannot say which a line is —
`dccex-usb` fans the whole conversation to everybody and routes nothing
(ADR-0043). So what arrives here is everything the station has to say to
anyone, and the reading is deliberately narrow: the power each track is in
and whether the emergency-stop lock is on. Everything else — the banner, a
slot's speed, a turnout the station keeps of its own, a sensor it polls, a
fast clock — is another client's business and is passed over unread.

Two functions, both pure. `messages` is the framing rule, bytes in and whole
messages out; `reply` is one message read into a fact or into `None`. Neither
raises, and a message this app does not recognise is not an error: it is the
ordinary case, most of the traffic on the port being somebody else's.

`dccex-usb` frames the same `<…>` delimiters and this is not shared with it.
Apps import `tc49.lib` and themselves, never each other (ADR-0013), and the
delimiters are the hardware's rather than a contract of ours — `dccex-usb`
mirrors a device and holds its own copy for the same reason it imports
nothing else of ours.
