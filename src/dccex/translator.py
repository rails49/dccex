"""dccex: the translator between the device vocabulary and the command station.

The first of the thin apps that hang under `layout` (ADR-0043). Above it the
bus carries the **device vocabulary** — what each device should do, and what
each is observed to do — and below it is one TCP connection to `dccex-usb`,
which owns the command station's serial device and serves it on port 2560 so
that JMRI and hand-held throttles share the same command station. That mirror
is another repository's app (rails49/dccex) and this one is a client of its
port beside the others; the USB device is never opened here.

**The boundary this app exists to hold.** Every other component is oblivious
to what powers the layout, and nothing above the layout interface expects
this command station or any other — they are one family of devices among
many. The `<…>` syntax is this app's private business: it appears on no bus
topic, in no other package and in no normative document, and `docs/dccex/`
is the only page in the repository that writes it down. A different command
station gets a different translator, or reaches the system through JMRI, and
nothing else moves.

*Subscribes* `tc49/layout/state/wanted/#`. *Publishes*
`tc49/layout/state/device/track` and `tc49/layout/state/device/link/<id>`,
where the id is the one this app is started with — the package's name where
it is given no other, a value and not a contract (ADR-0059).

**It acts on an address only if it recognises it**, and there is no ownership
table anywhere: every point and signal address it hears, and every traction
and function address, an address naming no system (ADR-0059). What this
station has no packet for — a turnout numbered outside the accessory range,
say — falls away where the packet is built. An address nothing answers to does
no harm, as a packet nobody picks up does.

**On connect it applies the retained desired state and does nothing else.**
The desired values are the whole picture, so there is no handshake and no
session state to agree: whatever `layout` last wanted is waiting on those
topics, and applying it is the whole of coming up. The track row goes first,
so nothing is commanded onto dead rails and a release's zeros land before the
speeds rather than over them.

**Powering on sends the startup file, if there is one.** `startup` names a
file of raw station commands, one per line, sent in order straight after the
track-on command; it is where a person writes the trip current each of this
railroad's power districts really takes, in the station's own language, and
the only place those values appear. A power district is a hardware fact that
reaches no bus topic (#217), and the file is not parsed beyond blank and
comment, so this app has no vocabulary for what is in it. Failing to read it
is logged and powers on anyway: a railroad coming up at the firmware's low
default trips early, which is safe and visible, where refusing to power on
over a missing file is neither (ADR-0050).

Two rules are not a row of the mapping table:

**The stop is the one-shot, and no row of this app's holds it.** `stopped`
tells every decoder to stand with the track still live and holds nothing
afterwards, so any throttle on the shared port may drive away from it. That
is the operator's call to make — they are the one holding the layout.
`device/track` is `on` and `off` (ADR-0063): the observed supply goes back to
`on` as soon as the broadcast is out, because the rails are live under a stop
and there is nothing else the supply could truthfully read. The stop is not
lost for going unobserved — `layout` holds the one it commanded and publishes
`state/power: stopped` above this app until a person clears it. A station's
emergency-stop *lock* would hold it in the hardware instead, which is the
better answer where a station has one, and nothing has to be asked before
using it: each translator implements `stopped` as well as its own hardware
allows and never by removing power (ADR-0063, decision 3). One product's
firmware-branch command is dialect this app absorbs, not a word the bus
learns (ADR-0058, #463, #464).

**An overload is polled for.** A district that trips is not broadcast on TCP
— the station cuts it and says so on its USB diagnostics only — so this app
asks for the status on a cadence of its own, and `device/track` telling the
truth does not depend on a person noticing.

**A clean exit stands the railroad down**, `shutdown()`: zero to every
locomotive this app has commanded, then the track off. The process ending is
not by itself an instruction to the railroad — the station goes on running
whatever it was last told — and a session that exits over a rolling
locomotive leaves it rolling, which is not recoverable the way switching the
power back on is. Whoever constructs this app calls it before letting the
loop go (`bench/runner.py`).

**No `device/point` is ever published.** This railroad's turnouts have no
feedback and the station's answer to a throw is one it faked (ADR-0022), so
the row stays empty: a faked observation is worse than silence (ADR-0050).

**`device/link`** is `up` while the station is answering, `down` otherwise,
with `detail` carrying what a person would want to read. It is the station
answering and not the socket being open: the poll goes on asking for as long
as the link lasts, and ten intervals of silence lower the row where the
connection underneath is still there — a station switched off behind a mirror
that holds its clients, a pulled cable, a wedged one. An answer afterwards
raises it again, and nothing is torn down for it (ADR-0066). That is where
the physical link becomes visible at runtime, which is where verifying it
belongs — not in a gate that would need a powered layout to pass. The same
words go on `device/track` as its `reason` while the station is unreachable,
so a person reading why the railroad is dark reads it off the supply itself
rather than off a second row (ADR-0059).

The framing and the mapping are pure and live in `replies` and `commands`;
what is here is the connection and the state that a connection is made of.
